**Application Notes**
This application simulates chemical bonding of different atoms together (Carbon, Hydrogen & Oxygen) to create stable molecules.
This experience is meant to be accessed in VR and most preferably using a Quest 2.

The interactions are as follows:

    1. Picking up atoms and placing them on the chalkboard using the grip button.
    2. Scaling of atoms and molecules by gripping them and pinching with both hands.
    3. Moving around by sliding using the left thumbstick.
    4. Teleport using the right thumbstick and releasing
    5. Creating and deleting atoms by gripping the buttons on the left of the chalkboard.
    6. Creating and deleteing molecules by griping the buttons on the right of the chalkboard.
    7. Deletion of molecules and atoms by placing them in the green trash bins.
