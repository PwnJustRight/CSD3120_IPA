# IPA-B Feedback for PHANG JIA RONG
                                        
**OVERALL IPA-A + IPA-B Grade**: B-

**IPA-B Grade**: C+
                                        
## B1
complete 3D scene (with (a) a background environment or live video feed and (b) manipulable objects) and clear consistent theme
                                        
## B2
desktop-based grab and translate interaction exists but very buggy (or you only had additional, e.g. HMD, interaction but did not implement desktop-based)
                                        
## B3
desktop-based attach interaction exists but very buggy (or you only had additional, e.g. HMD, interaction but did not implement desktop-based)
                                        
## B4
desktop-based rotate interaction exists but very buggy (or you only had additional, e.g. HMD, interaction but did not implement desktop-based)
                                        
## B5
desktop-based "pinch" interaction exists but very buggy (or you only had additional, e.g. HMD, interaction but did not implement desktop-based)
                                        
## B6
desktop-based locomotion interaction exists but very buggy (or you only had additional, e.g. HMD, interaction but did not implement desktop-based)
                                        
## Other feedback
really nice README :)
Good effort in making all interactions work with attention to UI (e.g., highlighting) but too bad you did not cater to the desktop-based interactions (the main requirement).
HMD interactions all felt pretty good.
